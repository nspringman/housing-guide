#Housing Guide

__page-housing.php__ lives in the current theme directory. This should be edited in an external text editor, not the WordPress panel.

__south40__ and __northside__ live in the root html directory.

For reasons I don't entirely understand (or, frankly, care to find out), when
working in the development clone simply going to a page like /northside/lofts
returns a 404, while on the live site this redirects properly. Just have to
append .html when working in the clone.
